Many of these ideas can be taken to the next level and explored or developed by NASA, while others will continue to be developed by those in the public sphere. Furthermore, a white paper written by a NASA retiree was submitted in conjunction with the challenge conclusion. This white paper summarized and analyzed the results of the challenge, sharing potential insights, next steps, and complementarities among the entries.<br />Significantly Advanced Towards a Solution<br />Planned for future implementation<br />Technical Solution</p>",
    "description": "Imagine you are on a mission to Mars. The journey to Mars and back is going to take two to three years, and there may not be any supply ships. To be as efficient and self-sufficient as possible, you will need to be able to recycle, repurpose, or reprocess things and make what you need from base materials. A completely efficient cycle is almost impossible, and some waste will have to be jettisoned to reduce mass and free up space inside the spacecraft. But ideally, you will have little to almost no waste since everything gets broken down and remade into new things. There are a lot of different kinds of waste on a spacecraft. What are the different ways that those useless waste streams can be repurposed?",
